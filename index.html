        <span id="greeting">Hello there</span> 👋<br>
        Welcome to my personal corner of the internet. My name is Lampard Kipyegon, a first-year Computer Science
        student at JKUAT, passionate about building things that make life a little smarter, smoother, and (occasionally)
        cooler.
        I created this site to document my journey, experiment with web development, and showcase some of the projects
        and ideas I'm currently exploring.
    </p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m a technology enthusiast with a growing interest in software engineering, computer systems, and how
        mathematics can be used to solve real-world problems.
        My academic journey is still at the early stages, but I’m already diving into several areas including:
    <ul class="ul">
        <li>Python programming</li>
        <li>Web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)</li>
        <li>Basic algorithms and data structures</li>
        <li>Discrete Mathematics</li>
        <li>Computer Architecture fundamentals</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Beyond classwork, I enjoy experimenting with small coding projects, exploring automation, and learning how
        different parts of technology connect to create systems we use every day.
        My long-term goal is to become a well-rounded developer capable of contributing to impactful software with clean
        design, efficient code, and user-friendly interfaces.

    <h1 id="about">Biography</h1>
    <p id="text">This is a bio for Lampard</p>
    <p>
        Lampard Kipyegon was born on March 14th, 2007, in a small but lively town known for its cool mornings, long
        walking paths, and a community that believed deeply in education. From the very beginning, Lampard stood out as
        the quiet kid who watched everything closely before acting — not shy, just observant.
    <h2>Early Childhood (2007 – 2010)</h2>
    Growing up, he was naturally curious. According to family stories, he learned to take apart toys long before he
    learned how to put them back together. Anything with moving parts fascinated him — remote controls, old radios,
    clocks that didn’t even tick anymore.
    His parents encouraged this curiosity by giving him room to explore. Instead of buying new toys all the time, they
    started handing him old household items just to see what he’d make of them. This habit planted the earliest seeds of
    his love for technology and understanding how things work beneath the surface.

    <h2>Pre-School Years (2010 – 2013)</h2>

    Lampard joined Bright Steps Kindergarten, where he discovered that he enjoyed learning as much as playing. He was
    especially good with patterns, colors, and memory-based games. Teachers noticed he had an unusually strong attention
    span for his age, especially during activities involving numbers or storytelling.

    During this period, he also developed a deep love for books. Picture books, animal encyclopedias, random science
    facts — he devoured them all. Saturdays became “library days,” a routine he kept for years.

    <h2>Lower Primary School (2013 – 2016)</h2>

    He enrolled at Green Valley Primary School, where his strengths became clearer. His performance in math and science
    stood out early; he enjoyed solving small puzzles, analyzing objects, and asking questions that often made teachers
    pause.

    He participated in:
    <ul>
        <li>Early learners’ science exhibitions</li>
        <li>School spelling competitions</li>
        <li>Junior math quizzes</li>
    </ul>

    He didn’t always win, but he consistently ranked among the top few — mainly because he treated these activities as
    personal challenges rather than competitions.

    During this time, his personality began taking shape: calm, thoughtful, friendly, and slightly competitive in the
    healthiest way possible.

    <h2>Upper Primary School (2016 – Class 8, 2020)</h2>

    By the time Lampard joined high school, he had become more focused and disciplined. He was the student who sat near
    the front, took neat notes, and asked questions that sometimes caught teachers off-guard.

    <h2>Academics</h2>

    He excelled particularly in:
    <ul>
        <li>Mathematics</li>
        <li>Science (especially anything involving experiments)</li>
        <li>Social Studies (he loved maps and timelines)</li>
    </ul>

    His teachers often described him as “a quiet leader” — someone who led by example rather than noise.

    <h2>Extracurricular Activities</h2>

    Despite his calm nature, Lampard got involved in several school activities:
    <ul>
        <li>Member of the school science club</li>
        <li>Participant in regional mathematics contests</li>
        <li>Assistant library prefect</li>
    </ul>
    Occasionally competed in athletics, preferring long-distance running

    <h2>Development of Interests</h2>

    Around Class 7, he encountered computers for the first time in a structured school setting. The computer lab became
    his favorite place instantly. He would often stay after lessons — sometimes with permission, sometimes with
    “creative permission” — to explore typing programs, educational games, and basic computer skills.

    By Class 8, he had become “the tech kid” of his class — the one teachers could count on to fix a frozen computer or
    help classmates navigate a program they didn’t understand.

    <h2>Completion of Class 8 (2021)</h2>

    Lampard completed Class 8 with strong grades, especially in math and science. His curiosity, discipline, and early
    exposure to technology set the foundation for his future path in computer science.

    Even before joining high school, he already knew he wanted to pursue something involving computers, problem-solving,
    and creativity — a decision that would guide the next phase of his academic life.
    </p>
    He was first introduced to programming after primary school when he finished doing his KCPE exams, where he
    discovered
    how satisfying it is to break down complex problems into simple, logical steps.
    He decided to learn HTML/CSS since he was curious about how websites were made and later learnt python.
    That curiosity eventually led him to pursue Computer Science at JKUAT. He’s particularly drawn to:
    <ul>
        <li>Python Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
        <li>Python Machine Learning and AI</li>
        <li>Web developmet with HTML/CSS/JS, REACT and NextJs</li>
        <li>Python Data Science, with Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib for visualizations</li>
    </ul>
    When he's not coding, he enjoys reading psychology books, watching documentaries, dissecting movie plots, and
    occasionally getting lost in anime worlds.
    He is naturally curious and love challenging himself exploring new things and topics.
