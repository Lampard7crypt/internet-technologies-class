        <span id="greeting">Hello there</span> 👋<br>
        Welcome to my personal corner of the internet. My name is Lampard Kipyegon, a first-year Computer Science
        student at JKUAT, passionate about building things that make life a little smarter, smoother, and (occasionally)
        cooler.
        I created this site to document my journey, experiment with web development, and showcase some of the projects
        and ideas I'm currently exploring.
    </p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m a technology enthusiast with a growing interest in software engineering, computer systems, and how
        mathematics can be used to solve real-world problems.
        My academic journey is still at the early stages, but I’m already diving into several areas including:
    <ul class="ul">
        <li>Python programming</li>
        <li>Web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)</li>
        <li>Basic algorithms and data structures</li>
        <li>Discrete Mathematics</li>
        <li>Computer Architecture fundamentals</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Beyond classwork, I enjoy experimenting with small coding projects, exploring automation, and learning how
        different parts of technology connect to create systems we use every day.
        My long-term goal is to become a well-rounded developer capable of contributing to impactful software with clean
        design, efficient code, and user-friendly interfaces.
    </p>

    <h2 id="about">Biography</h2>
    <p id="text">This is a brief bio of Lampard</p>
    I was first introduced to programming after primary school when I finished doing my KCPE exams, where I discovered
    how satisfying it is to break down complex problems into simple, logical steps.
    I decided to learn HTML/CSS since I was curious about how websites were made and later learnt python.
    That curiosity eventually led me to pursue Computer Science at JKUAT. I’m particularly drawn to:
    <ul>
        <li>Python Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
        <li>Python Machine Learning and AI</li>
        <li>Web development with HTML/CSS/JS, REACT and NextJs</li>
        <li>Python Data Science, with Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib for visualizations</li>
    </ul>
    When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading psychology books, watching documentaries, dissecting movie plots, and
    occasionally getting lost in anime worlds.
    I am naturally curious and love challenging myself exploring new things and topics.
